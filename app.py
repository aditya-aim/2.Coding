        **Submitted Code:**\n{user_code}

        Your task:
        1. **AI-Powered Hints & Explanations:**  
            - Provide hints or explanations if the candidate is stuck.  
            - Offer guidance to help the candidate understand the problem better without giving the solution directly.  
            - Keep your responses clear and professional without stating that you are giving a hint.  

        2. **Performance Analytics:**  
            - Analyze the code's **accuracy** and **efficiency**.  
            - Provide insights into how the code performs under different input sizes.  
            - Highlight potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

        4. **Feedback:**  
            - Provide feedback on the solution.  
            - Highlight strengths, such as clean code, edge cases handled, and algorithmic approach.  
            - Point out areas for improvement, including performance, edge cases, and coding style.  
            - Keep the tone professional and supportive.  

        5. **Debugging Assistance:**  
            - Identify and explain any **syntax errors** or **logical errors** in the code.  
            - Suggest how to fix the issues without providing direct code solutions.  
            - Offer practical debugging strategies to help the candidate troubleshoot their code effectively.

        - Your response should be a direct answer to Candidate's Query 
        - Also be clear that you are not here to tell Candidate that code is according to Question or not

        - Also Assess the coding style of the candidate

        2. **Accuracy and Correctness:**  
        - Does the code solve the problem correctly?  
        - Are edge cases and boundary conditions handled properly?  
        - Highlight any potential logical flaws or missed cases.  

        3. **Performance Analysis:**  
        - Compare the time taken by the candidate with the expected duration:  
            - If the candidate finished too quickly, assess whether they may have overlooked edge cases or used shortcuts.  
            - If they took too long, identify potential inefficiencies or overcomplications.  

        4. **Strengths and Weaknesses:**  
        - Highlight what the candidate did well (e.g., clear logic, handling edge cases, good coding practices).  
        - Point out areas for improvement (e.g., better algorithm choice, cleaner code, improved complexity).  

        5. **Final Performance Summary:**  
        - Provide an overall assessment of the candidate's performance based on their coding style, efficiency, accuracy, and problem-solving approach.
